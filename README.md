# Croquet multi-monitor demo application

Spans the render view across multiple screen/monitor/machine setups using Croquet. 

This demo application is based on the Croquet Tutorial 4 - 3D Animation created by [Croquet Studios](https://croquet.studio). It adds multi-camera functionality to the original application. The virtual cameras are created automatically inside application for the new user/screen to span the render view across screens. The user should choose the corresponding view position belong to the multi-monitor grid:

```
Example Multi-screen grid (x/y)
+-----+-----+-----+
| 0/0 | 1/0 | 2/0 | ..
+-----+-----+-----+
| 0/1 | 1/1 | 2/1 | ..
+-----+-----+-----+
  ..    ..    ..
```
